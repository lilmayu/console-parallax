# Console Parallax

![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)

A simple Java library handling console input and treating it as a CLI.

It is designed to be quickly used, without any fuss and large amount of code or reading.

With the magic of annotations and without. ***It is up to you.***

## TODOs
- Docs
- Bonuses:
  - Annotations
  - Advanced command parser (--help, --name="some-value", etc.)
